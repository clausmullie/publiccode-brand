# Stewardship

To show that we are stewarding a codebase, these badges can be used in the footer of a website for that codebase.
The badge should link to the overview page for the codebase on our website so that the claim is verifiable.
By adding `?utm_medium=badge&utm_source=[website name]` to the URL we can easier look at the statistics in our [Plausible](https://plausible.io/publiccode.net) instance.
